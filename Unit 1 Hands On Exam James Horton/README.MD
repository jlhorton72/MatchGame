## Analysis Steps
This exam breaks down to using the line, arc, and circle shapes of javafx and displaying them to shape the hangman.

### Design
Begin with the arc to make the base/ground of the hangman. Place on bottom to the left of center.
Raise a line upward from the center of the arc.
From top of the vertical line, run a line horizontal to the right.
From the rightmost end of the horizontal line, drop a short line straight down.
At the end of that line, place a circle that only touches the end of the line at the radius.
From the bottom radius of the circle drop anther line straight downward.
For the arms, place diaganol lines off either side of this body line, about a third of the way down.
For the legs, place diaganol lines off either side of this body line but at the lower end of it.

### Testing
This was a test as you go.  Build each individual piece, placing it and checking to see if it needs to move
