## Assignment Comments

- Comparable interface implemented on GeometricObject class
- max method created in the GeometricObject class
- find larger of two circles and larger of two rectangles
 


Comparable implemented at the wrong level in the class structure. No deduction, because I know the
same concepts had to be explored. Consider how you would implement the max method in GeometricObject.
